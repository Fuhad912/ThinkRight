"subject": "Chemistry",
"topic": "Separation of mixtures and purification of chemical substances",
"question": "Ethanol (b.p. 78°C) and glycerol (b.p. 290°C) form a homogeneous mixture. Why is fractional distillation preferred over simple distillation for their separation?",
"options": {
"A": "Glycerol decomposes at its boiling point",
"B": "Ethanol forms an azeotrope with glycerol",
"C": "The large boiling point difference requires precise temperature control",
"D": "Fractional distillation provides multiple vaporization-condensation cycles for better separation efficiency"
},
"correct_option": "D",
"explanation": "Despite the large bp difference, fractional distillation's fractionating column allows repeated condensation and vaporization, enhancing purity by separating components with closer volatility profiles in complex mixtures."

"question": "A student observes that a sample of 'pure' benzoic acid melts over a range of 119–122°C instead of the standard 122°C. What does this indicate?",
"options": {
"A": "The sample is impure",
"B": "The thermometer is miscalibrated",
"C": "Benzoic acid decomposes before melting",
"D": "Atmospheric pressure is below standard"
},
"correct_option": "A",
"explanation": "Pure crystalline compounds melt sharply at specific temperatures. A melting point range indicates impurities disrupting crystal lattice stability. Calibration or pressure issues would shift the entire range, not broaden it."

"B": "The mixture forms a minimum-boiling azeotrope at ~78.2°C",
"C": "Water decomposes before boiling",
"D": "Ethanol is less dense than water"
},
"correct_option": "B",
"explanation": "Ethanol-water forms a binary azeotrope (95.6% ethanol) boiling at 78.2°C—lower than pure ethanol or water. This azeotrope distills first, enriching the distillate in ethanol initially."
},
{
"exam": "JAMB",
"subject": "Chemistry",
"topic": "Separation of mixtures and purification of chemical substances",
"question": "In column chromatography, why is sand often layered on top of the adsorbent (e.g., silica gel)?",
"options": {
"A": "To increase column height for better separation",
"B": "To prevent disturbance of the adsorbent surface when adding sample or eluent",
"C": "To act as a secondary adsorbent for polar compounds",
"D": "To reduce the flow rate of the eluent"
},
"correct_option": "B",
"explanation": "The sand layer protects the silica gel surface from erosion or channeling when liquid samples or solvents are poured. It ensures even distribution without compacting the adsorbent."
},
{

"options": {
"A": "Density",
"B": "Solubility",
"C": "Magnetic susceptibility",
"D": "Particle size"
},
"correct_option": "B",
"explanation": "FeSO₄ is water-soluble while sand (SiO₂) is insoluble. Dissolution followed by filtration separates them based on solubility differences. Density/magnetism/size are secondary factors here."

"question": "A student attempts to separate ink components using paper chromatography but observes only one spot. Which modification would most likely resolve multiple components?",
"options": {
"A": "Using a shorter chromatography paper",
"B": "Increasing the sample concentration",
"C": "Changing to a less polar solvent system",
"D": "Heating the developing chamber"
},
"correct_option": "C",
"explanation": "A single spot suggests poor resolution due to inadequate solvent polarity. Adjusting solvent polarity (e.g., less polar) alters relative affinities for stationary/mobile phases, improving separation of components with similar Rf values."
},
{
"exam": "JAMB",
"subject": "Chemistry",
"topic": "Separation of mixtures and purification of chemical substances",
"question": "Why is decantation unsuitable for separating a mixture of oil and water after shaking?",
"options": {
"A": "Oil and water form an emulsion",
"B": "Both liquids are miscible",
"C": "The mixture has uniform density",
"D": "Decantation requires solid-liquid separation"
},
"correct_option": "A",
"explanation": "Shaking creates a stable emulsion where tiny oil droplets disperse in water (or vice versa), preventing clear phase separation. Decantation relies on distinct layers forming rapidly, which emulsions inhibit."
},
{
"exam": "JAMB",
"subject": "Chemistry",
"topic": "Separation of mixtures and purification of chemical substances",
"question": "During sublimation of ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl), what chemical change occurs?",
"options": {

"B": "NH₄Cl(s) → N₂(g) + 2H₂(g) + Cl₂(g)",
"C": "2NH₄Cl(s) → 2NH₃(g) + Cl₂(g) + H₂(g)",
"D": "No chemical change occurs"
},
"correct_option": "A",
"explanation": "NH₄Cl sublimes via thermal decomposition into ammonia and hydrogen chloride gases, which recombine on cooling. This is a reversible chemical change, not merely physical phase transition."
},
{
"exam": "JAMB",
"subject": "Chemistry",
"topic": "Separation of mixtures and purification of chemical substances",
"question": "A mixture of two liquids X and Y shows a constant boiling point of 85°C. Pure X boils at 75°C and pure Y at 95°C. What can be concluded?",
"options": {
"A": "X and Y form an azeotrope",
"B": "The mixture is ideal",
"C": "Y is impure",
"D": "X and Y are immiscible"
},
"correct_option": "A",
"explanation": "A constant boiling mixture with bp different from either pure component indicates an azeotrope. Here, the bp (85°C) is between 75°C and 95°C, suggesting a non-ideal mixture forming an azeotrope."

"A": "To catalyze crystallization",
"B": "To adsorb colored impurities",
"C": "To increase solubility",
"D": "To reduce pH"
},
"correct_option": "B",
"explanation": "Activated charcoal has high surface area and adsorbs organic impurities (especially colored ones) via van der Waals forces. After adsorption, it's removed by filtration, leaving a purer solution for crystallization."
},
{
"exam": "JAMB",
"subject": "Chemistry",
"topic": "Separation of mixtures and purification of chemical substances",
"question": "In the separation of a mixture of kerosene (density 0.81 g/cm³) and water, what is the role of a separating funnel?",
"options": {
"A": "To evaporate kerosene",
"B": "To filter solid impurities",
"C": "To allow separation based on density difference and immiscibility",
"D": "To induce chemical reaction between layers"
},

},
{
"exam": "JAMB",
"subject": "Chemistry",
"topic": "Separation of mixtures and purification of chemical substances",
"question": "A student separates salt and sand by adding water, filtering, and evaporating the filtrate. If the final salt mass is less than expected, what is the most likely cause?",
"options": {
"A": "Incomplete dissolution of salt",
"B": "Evaporation of salt with water vapor",
"C": "Loss of filtrate during transfer",
"D": "Sand dissolving in water"
},
"correct_option": "C",
"explanation": "Salt (soluble) passes into filtrate; sand (insoluble) remains on filter paper. Mass loss occurs if filtrate is spilled during transfer to evaporating dish. Salt doesn't evaporate (B), sand doesn't dissolve (D), and incomplete dissolution (A) would leave salt in residue."
},
{
"exam": "JAMB",
"subject": "Chemistry",
"topic": "Separation of mixtures and purification of chemical substances",
"question": "Which separation method relies on differences in volatility under reduced pressure?",
"options": {
"A": "Steam distillation",
"B": "Vacuum distillation",
"C": "Zone refining",
"D": "Differential extraction"
},
"correct_option": "B",
"explanation": "Vacuum distillation lowers pressure to reduce boiling points, allowing separation of heat-sensitive compounds (e.g., glycerol) that decompose at their atmospheric boiling points. Volatility differences are magnified under vacuum."
},
{
"exam": "JAMB",
"subject": "Chemistry",
"topic": "Separation of mixtures and purification of chemical substances",
"question": "Why can't a mixture of ethanol and water be completely separated by fractional distillation?",
"options": {

"C": "They form a minimum-boiling azeotrope at 95.6% ethanol",
"D": "Ethanol decomposes during distillation"
},
"correct_option": "C",
"explanation": "Ethanol-water forms a minimum-boiling azeotrope (bp 78.2°C) containing 95.6% ethanol. Distillation yields this azeotrope, not pure ethanol, due to non-ideal vapor-liquid equilibrium."
},
{
"exam": "JAMB",
"subject": "Chemistry",
"topic": "Separation of mixtures and purification of chemical substances",
"question": "In the purification of table salt (NaCl) contaminated with MgCl₂, why is the salt dissolved in water, treated with NaOH, filtered, and then re-crystallized?",
"options": {
"A": "NaOH converts MgCl₂ to insoluble Mg(OH)₂",
"B": "NaOH increases NaCl solubility",
"C": "NaOH prevents oxidation of NaCl",
"D": "NaOH catalyzes crystallization"
},
"correct_option": "A",
"explanation": "MgCl₂ reacts with NaOH to form insoluble Mg(OH)₂ precipitate, which is removed by filtration. NaCl remains dissolved and is recovered pure by crystallization. This exploits solubility differences after chemical treatment."
},
{
"exam": "JAMB",

"question": "What is the primary advantage of using solvent extraction over distillation for heat-sensitive natural products like plant alkaloids?",
"options": {
"A": "Lower cost",
"B": "Higher purity",
"C": "Avoidance of thermal decomposition",
"D": "Faster processing"
},

"B": "Iron filings are ferromagnetic while sulfur is diamagnetic",
"C": "Sulfur dissolves in water but iron does not",
"D": "Iron has higher density"
},
"correct_option": "B",
"explanation": "Iron filings are ferromagnetic (strongly attracted to magnets), while sulfur is diamagnetic (weakly repelled). Magnetization exploits this magnetic property difference without chemical change."
},
{
"exam": "JAMB",
"subject": "Chemistry",
"topic": "Separation of mixtures and purification of chemical substances",
"question": "During filtration, why is the filter paper folded into a cone and moistened with solvent before use?",
"options": {
"A": "To increase flow rate",
"B": "To prevent tearing",
"C": "To ensure adhesion to the funnel wall and eliminate air pockets",
"D": "To activate adsorption sites"
},
"correct_option": "C",

},
{
"exam": "JAMB",
"subject": "Chemistry",
"topic": "Separation of mixtures and purification of chemical substances",
"question": "Which technique is most suitable for separating a mixture of gases (O₂, N₂, Ar) based on their different rates of diffusion?",
"options": {
"A": "Fractional distillation",
"B": "Graham's law effusion",
"C": "Chemical absorption",
"D": "Membrane separation"
},
"correct_option": "B",
"explanation": "Graham's law states effusion rate ∝ 1/√(molar mass). Lighter gases (O₂=32, N₂=28, Ar=40) effuse faster through a porous barrier. This principle is used in gas separation plants for isotopic enrichment."
},
{
"exam": "JAMB",
"subject": "Chemistry",
"topic": "Separation of mixtures and purification of chemical substances",
"question": "Why does adding seed crystals during crystallization promote the formation of larger, purer crystals?",
"options": {
"A": "Seeds catalyze the reaction",
"B": "Seeds provide nucleation sites for orderly crystal growth",
"C": "Seeds increase solubility",
"D": "Seeds remove impurities"
},
"correct_option": "B",
"explanation": "Seed crystals act as nucleation points, allowing solute molecules to deposit in an ordered lattice. This reduces random nucleation (which forms small impure crystals) and favors slow growth of larger, purer crystals."
},
{
"exam": "JAMB",
"subject": "Chemistry",
"topic": "Separation of mixtures and purification of chemical substances",
"question": "In the separation of a mixture of sand and iodine using sublimation, why is the sublimed iodine collected on a cold finger rather than the funnel walls?",
"options": {
"A": "To prevent contamination with sand",
"B": "To maximize surface area for condensation",
"C": "To avoid thermal decomposition",
"D": "To facilitate easy scraping of crystals"
},
"correct_option": "D",
"explanation": "A cold finger (condenser) provides a dedicated, smooth surface for iodine vapor to deposit as crystals. This allows easy scraping without disturbing the sand residue, unlike funnel walls where crystals mix with sand."
