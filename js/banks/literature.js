      "D": "directly address and involve the audience in the drama"
    },
    "correct_option": "C",

      "D": "granting the reader access to the thoughts of every character"
    },
    "correct_option": "B",
    "explanation": "A first-person point of view ('I') is subjective. The reader experiences the story through the narrator's senses, emotions, and opinions, which may be unreliable or limited in scope compared to a third-person omniscient narrator."

    },
    "correct_option": "C",
    "explanation": "The imagery used—'tomb,' 'forgotten ambitions,' 'dust of resignation,' 'grave of another potential tomorrow'—collectively creates a powerful sense of hopelessness, inertia, and dead-end existence, which is best described as oppressive stagnation."

    "correct_option": "B",
    "explanation": "Jimmy Porter is the archetypal 'Angry Young Man.' His rage, often directed at Alison and her family, is largely a dramatic expression of his broader fury against the British class system, social hypocrisy, and the lack of opportunity in post-war England."

    },
    "correct_option": "B",
    "explanation": "The setting in *Wuthering Heights* is pathetic fallacy. The wild, harsh, and unpredictable environment of the moors directly reflects and amplifies the intense, often destructive emotions—love, hatred, revenge, obsession—that drive the characters, particularly Heathcliff and Catherine."

    },
    "correct_option": "D",
    "explanation": "Angelou's poem is a powerful allegory for racial oppression and the yearning for freedom. The caged bird symbolizes African Americans and other oppressed groups, its clipped wings and bars representing systemic restrictions, while its song is the undying cry for liberty and dignity."

      "C": "foreshadowing",
      "D": "stream of consciousness"
    },
    "correct_option": "C",
    "explanation": "Foreshadowing is a technique where the writer suggests or hints at plot developments that will come later. It creates anticipation and prepares the reader, often subtly, for future events. It is different from flashback (looking back) or suspense (anxiety about the outcome)."

      "C": "metaphor",
      "D": "hyperbole"
    },
    "correct_option": "C",
    "explanation": "The poet states 'The wind *is* a lion,' which is a direct comparison asserting that one thing is another, without using 'like' or 'as.' This is a metaphor. The entire description of the wind's actions (roaring, tearing with claws) extends this initial metaphorical identification."

      "D": "physical strength and success in winning Sidi's love"
    },
    "correct_option": "B",
    "explanation": "Lakunle is a comic figure whose 'modern' ideas are portrayed as hollow, pretentious, and out of touch with the practical realities and valued traditions of Ilujinle. Soyinka satirizes his slavish mimicry of Western manners and bookish knowledge, which is contrasted with Baroka's cunning and rooted intelligence."

      "C": "religious conflict",
      "D": "tribal warfare"
    },
    "correct_option": "B",
    "explanation": "From the outset, Adah's ambition to go to school is thwarted by societal norms that privilege the education of boys over girls. This establishes the central theme of gender discrimination, which continues in her life in England, intersecting with racial and class prejudice."

      "C": "a balance of strengths and an understanding of collective need",
      "D": "leadership to be inherited rather than elected"
    },
    "correct_option": "C",
    "explanation": "The poem is an allegory for political leadership. Each animal is rejected for an extreme quality (the lion's ferocity, the hyena's greed). The moral lies in the closing lines: '...the kingdom is tattered and torn / ...the throne is a wasteland, haunted / by the ghosts of the many who have sat on it.' The implied solution is a leader who can blend virtues and serve the common good."

      "A": "a soliloquy",
      "B": "a monologue",
      "C": "an aside",
      "D": "a prologue"
    },
    "correct_option": "C",
    "explanation": "An aside is a brief remark spoken by a character directly to the audience, breaking the 'fourth wall.' It is understood that other characters on stage do not hear it. This differs from a soliloquy, which is a longer speech delivered while the character is alone, revealing inner thoughts."

    },
    "correct_option": "C",
    "explanation": "A round character is complex, multifaceted, and capable of growth and change, much like a real person. They are often central to the narrative. This contrasts with a 'flat' character, who is one-dimensional and static, or a 'foil,' who highlights traits of another character."

      "A": "dialogue",
      "B": "an aside",
      "C": "a prologue",

    },
    "correct_option": "D",
    "explanation": "The stage direction 'speaking softly to himself' and the content of the speech—an internal debate about a moral dilemma—are hallmarks of a soliloquy. The character is alone (or believes themselves to be) and is articulating their private thoughts for the audience's benefit."

    "correct_option": "C",
    "explanation": "This line is part of the poem's central metaphysical conceit. The lovers see themselves reflected in each other's eyes, suggesting their souls are united and their world is self-contained. It represents an ideal, reciprocal love where two become one, creating their own perfect universe."

    "correct_option": "C",
    "explanation": "Melodrama relies on stock characters (the hero, heroine, villain), clear moral polarization, and plot twists designed to appeal directly to the audience's emotions. Its primary goal is to create excitement and sentimental appeal, often at the expense of subtle characterisation or realistic plotting."

    },
    "correct_option": "B",
    "explanation": "The language used—'made an entrance,' 'audience,' 'measured stride,' 'waiting for the silence'—frames the character's behaviour in terms of a performance. It suggests he is acutely conscious of the effect he has on others and deliberately stages his appearances to command attention."

    "correct_option": "B",
    "explanation": "Neto's poem is a lamentation and celebration of Africa. The 'grieved lands' are a metonymy—the physical land stands for the people who inhabit it. Their 'grief' represents the collective suffering endured through slavery, colonialism, and exploitation, while the poem also speaks of their enduring song (spirit) and hope."

His exit represents a healthy choice to remove himself from a situation that offers him little but emotional labour and conflict, highlighting the unsustainable nature of the central relationship."

    "explanation": "Neto explicitly connects the sorrow of the land ('grieved lands') to the historical reality of forced or exploited labour under colonialism. The 'black man's sweat' fertilizing crops like coffee and cotton for export signifies the extraction of both natural and human resources, a primary cause of Africa's historical suffering."
