    "question": "Read the passage below and answer the question:\n\nPASSAGE I\nThe trajectory of modern urbanization in developing nations is often characterized by a dichotomy of rapid infrastructural expansion and the simultaneous deepening of socio-economic fissures. While skyscrapers pierce the skyline, signaling robust economic health, the sprawling shantytowns at their feet tell a different story—one of systemic neglect and widening inequality. This juxtaposition is not merely aesthetic; it is symptomatic of a policy framework that prioritizes capital accumulation over inclusive growth. Urban planners frequently cite 'gentrification' as a necessary evil for modernization, yet the displacement of indigenous communities often results in the erasure of cultural heritage, creating sterile metropolises devoid of the vibrant chaos that once defined them. Critics argue that sustainable development must transcend mere architectural grandeur and address the human element, ensuring that the city remains a habitat for all, not just a playground for the elite.\n\nQuestion: According to the passage, the author implies that modern urbanization in developing nations is:",
