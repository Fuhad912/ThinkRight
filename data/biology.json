"question": "Hemophilia is more common in males because:",
"options": {
"A": "It is dominant",
"B": "It is a recessive trait on the X chromosome",
"C": "Males have two X chromosomes",
"D": "It is carried on the Y chromosome"
},
"correct_option": "B",
"explanation": "Hemophilia is X-linked recessive. Males (XY) need only one recessive allele to express it, while females (XX) need two. Carrier females usually don't show symptoms."

"question": "Color blindness is inherited as a sex-linked recessive trait. A colorblind man marries a normal woman (non-carrier). What proportion of their sons will be colorblind?",
"options": {
"A": "0%",
"B": "25%",
"C": "50%",
"D": "100%"
},
"correct_option": "A",
"explanation": "A colorblind man (XcY) married to a normal non-carrier woman (XCXC) will produce daughters who are carriers (XCXc) and sons who are normal (XCY). All sons receive the Y from father and XC from mother, so 0% will be colorblind."

"question": "Lamarck's theory of evolution proposed that:",
"options": {
"A": "Random mutations drive evolution",
"B": "Acquired characteristics can be inherited",
"C": "Natural selection is the mechanism",
"D": "Species never change"
},
"correct_option": "B",
"explanation": "Lamarck proposed that organisms develop characteristics through use or disuse during their lifetime, and these acquired traits are passed to offspring. This theory has been disproven by modern genetics."

"exam": "JAMB",
"subject": "Biology",
"topic": "Lamarck's theory",
"question": "According to Lamarck, a giraffe's long neck developed because:",
"options": {
"A": "Random genetic variation",
"B": "Ancestral giraffes stretched their necks to reach high leaves, and this trait was inherited",
"C": "Natural selection favored individuals with longer necks",
"D": "Mutation occurred suddenly"
},
"correct_option": "B",
"explanation": "Lamarck explained that giraffes continually stretched their necks to reach high vegetation, and this acquired elongation was passed to offspring. This 'use and disuse' concept is now known to be incorrect."

"question": "Darwin's theory of natural selection states that:",
"options": {
"A": "All organisms are perfectly adapted",
"B": "Organisms with favorable variations survive and reproduce more successfully",
"C": "Acquired traits are inherited",
"D": "Species cannot change"
},
"correct_option": "B",
"explanation": "Darwin proposed that individuals with variations better suited to their environment have higher survival and reproduction rates, passing these favorable traits to offspring, leading to evolutionary change."

"question": "The key mechanism in Darwin's theory of evolution is:",
"options": {
"A": "Use and disuse",
"B": "Natural selection",
"C": "Inheritance of acquired characteristics",
"D": "Spontaneous generation"
},
"correct_option": "B",
"explanation": "Natural selection is the cornerstone of Darwin's theory: environmental pressures 'select' individuals with advantageous traits, which survive to reproduce, gradually changing populations over time."

"A": "Deliberate efforts by organisms",
"B": "Random mutations and genetic recombination",
"C": "Environmental changes directly",
"D": "Parental wishes"
},
"correct_option": "B",
"explanation": "Darwin observed natural variation exists in populations. Modern genetics explains this variation arises from random mutations, genetic recombination during sexual reproduction, and gene flow."

"B": "All life forms evolved from simpler pre-existing organisms",
"C": "Species are unchanging",
"D": "Evolution occurs only in plants"
},
"correct_option": "B",
"explanation": "The organic theory (also called theory of descent) proposes that complex organisms evolved gradually from simpler forms through natural processes over millions of years, supported by fossil evidence."

"A": "All species existed simultaneously",
"B": "Progressive changes in organisms over geological time",
"C": "No relationship between extinct and living species",
"D": "Species never go extinct"
},
"correct_option": "B",
"explanation": "Fossils in different rock layers show progression from simple to complex organisms over time, transitional forms linking different groups, and extinct species related to modern ones."

"D": "Random changes only"
},
"correct_option": "B",
"explanation": "During industrial revolution, dark moths became more common in polluted areas (better camouflage on soot-covered trees), while light moths survived better in unpolluted areas, demonstrating natural selection."

"B": "Lamarck emphasized acquired traits, Darwin emphasized natural selection of inherited variations",
"C": "They are identical theories",
"D": "Darwin rejected all change"
},
"correct_option": "B",
"explanation": "Lamarck thought organisms acquire traits through use/disuse and pass them on. Darwin proposed that natural selection acts on random inherited variations already present in populations."
