    },
    "correct_option": "B",

    },
    "correct_option": "B",
    "explanation": "Constitutional monarchy balances tradition and modernity by retaining the monarch as a symbolic figurehead while actual governance is exercised by elected officials and parliament. This provides stability, continuity, and cultural identity while maintaining democratic principles."

      "C": "Democracy",
      "D": "Aristocracy"
    },
    "correct_option": "C",
    "explanation": "Popular sovereignty means that ultimate political authority resides in the people. Democracy, through elections, referendums, and representative institutions, most effectively embodies this principle by making government accountable to citizens and deriving its power from their consent."

      "C": "is found only in federal systems",
      "D": "eliminates the need for executive approval of laws"
    },
    "correct_option": "B",
    "explanation": "Bicameral means 'two chambers' - a legislature with two separate houses (like Senate and House of Representatives), while unicameral has only one chamber. Bicameralism provides additional checks on legislation and can represent different interests or constituencies."

      "D": "override presidential vetoes with supermajority votes"
    },
    "correct_option": "C",
    "explanation": "Judicial review is the power of courts to examine laws and executive actions to determine whether they conform to the constitution. This power allows the judiciary to invalidate unconstitutional laws or actions, serving as a crucial check on legislative and executive powers."

      "D": "eliminate the need for judicial proceedings"
    },
    "correct_option": "C",
    "explanation": "Executive clemency powers (pardons, commutations) serve as a final check against potential injustices, allowing consideration of factors beyond strict legal interpretation. This power shows mercy and can correct disproportionate sentences while respecting judicial independence."

These mechanisms allow legislatures to scrutinize executive performance without directly managing executive functions, maintaining separation of powers."

      "C": "courts exercise judicial review over legislation",
      "D": "judicial decisions are subject to public criticism"
    },
    "correct_option": "B",
    "explanation": "Judicial independence requires security of tenure and remuneration. When the executive can manipulate judges' salaries or remove them without proper process, judges may fear reprisal for unpopular decisions, compromising their ability to rule impartially and check executive power."

    },
    "correct_option": "B",
    "explanation": "The power of appropriation involves legislative control over government spending through budget approval. This 'power of the purse' is a crucial check on executive authority, as no money can be spent without legislative authorization, enabling fiscal oversight."

    },
    "correct_option": "B",

    "correct_option": "B",

    },
    "correct_option": "B",
    "explanation": "Entrenchment makes certain crucial provisions (rights, federal structure, amendment procedures) more difficult to change than others, requiring supermajorities or referendums. This protects core constitutional values from erosion by temporary political majorities while allowing less fundamental provisions to be more easily modified."

    },
    "correct_option": "B",
    "explanation": "Nigeria adopted federalism to manage its ethnic, religious, linguistic, and regional diversity within a unified state. Federalism allows different groups some autonomy over local affairs while maintaining national government for common concerns, theoretically preventing domination by any single group and reducing secessionist pressures."

    "correct_option": "B",
    "explanation": "Nigerian federalism suffers from excessive federal dominance, controlling most revenues (especially oil), maintaining extensive exclusive legislative list, and often intervening in state matters. This centralization contradicts federal principles of shared sovereignty, weakening states' autonomy and making them dependent on federal allocations."

    "explanation": "Revenue allocation conflicts center on oil wealth distribution. Oil-producing states demand higher derivation percentages compensating for environmental degradation, while non-producing states favor greater equality based on population or needs.

    "correct_option": "B",
    "explanation": "While state creation addressed minority aspirations and reduced regional power, many states lack economic viability, generating minimal internal revenue and depending almost entirely on federal allocations.

    "correct_option": "B",
    "explanation": "Derivation allocates a percentage of revenues (currently 13% for oil) to states where resources originate.
